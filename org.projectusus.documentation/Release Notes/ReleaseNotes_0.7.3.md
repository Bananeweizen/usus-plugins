# Usus 0.7.3 Release Notes


## New Features

In the Class and Package Graph, one can display all direct neighbours of any node (from the node's context menu). This also works on multiple selections.

If the Cockpit View is not visible, Usus will not calculate any changes. Instead, it collects the changes and calculates them in one go when the Cockpit View becomes visible again.

In the Hotspot Trends, new and removed hotspots are now distinguishable from changed hotspots.

The overall trend in the Cockpit view is now based on the sum of the trends (formerly, the overall trend was negative whenever there was one single negative trend).

## Removed Features


## Bug Fixes

In the Hotspots view, the sort order of the entries is now primarily determined by their hotspot size, not by their trend size.

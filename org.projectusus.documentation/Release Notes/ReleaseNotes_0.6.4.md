# Usus 0.6.4 Release Notes

## New Features

### Select all classes in same package

When you are in the Usus Class Graph and a node is selected, you can now select all classes in the same package from the context menu.

### Contracts for Java (C4J)

Some of the classes in Usus Core now have contracts. We will add more of them over time. For the interested, those can be enabled as described in the
[Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/projectusus/wiki/Contracts4Java).

## Bug Fixes

### Method/field chaining

Usus was unable to detect dependencies between classes when methods or fields were chained.

### Open Hotspots in e4

Double-clicking hotspots to open them was broken in Eclipse 4.
